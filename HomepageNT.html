<p>Networking refers to connecting computers, devices, and systems to share resources, exchange data, and facilitate 
       communication. It encompasses both the physical hardware, such as routers, switches, and cables, and the software protocols governing data transmission, such as TCP/IP. Networking can occur on different scales, from local area networks (LANs) that 
       connect devices within a small area, like an office, to wide area networks (WANs) that span large geographical regions. The growth 
       of the internet and cloud technologies has expanded the scope of networking, enabling seamless global communication and data sharing.
       Effective networking ensures that data flows securely and efficiently, supporting everything from business operations to personal 
       connections.</p>
