       <h2>Description</h2>

<p>Copper-based systems utilize copper wires to transmit electrical signals for communication purposes. 
  These systems have been a cornerstone of telecommunications since the invention of the telephone in the 19th 
  century. The two primary types of copper infrastructure are twisted pair cables, commonly used in traditional 
  telephone networks (Plain Old Telephone Service, or POTS) and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet, and coaxial 
  cables, often used for cable television and broadband internet. Copper systems are known for their reliability in 
  short-distance communication but face limitations in bandwidth and signal quality over long distances.</p>

  <p>Fiber-based systems use optical fibers—thin strands of glass or plastic—to transmit data 
    as pulses of light. These systems have become the backbone of modern telecommunications due 
    to their ability to handle vast amounts of data at high speeds. Fiber-optic technology supports 
    applications like Fiber to the Home (FTTH), where fiber cables are run directly to residences, and Dense 
    Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM), which allows multiple data streams to travel over a single fiber
    by using different wavelengths of light. Fiber systems are highly resistant to interference and signal loss,
    making them ideal for long-distance communication.</p>


  <h3> Functions</h3>

  <p>Copper-based systems transmit voice, data, and video signals as electrical impulses through copper wires. 
    They connect homes and businesses to telecom networks, enabling services like landline telephony, DSL internet, and cable broadband.</p>
  
  <p>Fiber-based systems transmit data, voice, and video signals as light pulses through optical fibers, offering ultra-high-speed connectivity.</p>
