<p>Telecom systems enable communication over long distances by transmitting voice, data, and video signals. 
       They can be broadly categorized into copper-based, fiber-based, and wireless-based systems, each with distinct 
       technologies, advantages, and use cases. </p>
</table>

       <h2>Copper-Based Systems</h2>
<p>Copper-based systems use copper wires to transmit electrical signals for communication. These systems have been foundational
       to telecommunications since the 19th century. </p>

       <h3>Wireless-Based systems</h3>

       <p>Wireless-based systems transmit data through radio waves, microwaves, or other electromagnetic signals, 
              eliminating the need for physical cables.</p>
