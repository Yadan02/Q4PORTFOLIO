       <h2>Summary of Networking Concepts</h2>
<p>Networking involves connecting computers and devices to share resources like data, hardware, and services. 
       Essential components include routers, switches, hubs, and network interfaces, with IP addresses ensuring 
       unique device identification for accurate data routing. Networking enhances communication, resource sharing,
       cost efficiency, and collaboration. Networks are categorized by scale: Local Area Networks (LANs) for small areas,
       Wide Area Networks (WANs) for large regions, and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) for city-wide coverage, each 
       tailored to specific user or organizational needs.
       </p>

       <h3>Wired Networks</h3>
       <p>Wired networks use physical cables (e.g., Ethernet, Cat5e, Cat6, or fiber-optic) to connect devices, relying 
              on hardware like routers, switches, and network interface cards (NICs). They offer high reliability,
              faster speeds, lower latency, and enhanced security due to physical connections. However, they lack
              flexibility, as devices are tethered, and installation can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, 
              cables may create clutter and limit device mobility.
       </p>

       <h4>Wireless Networks</h4>

       <p>Wireless networks transmit data via radio frequencies or infrared signals, enabling connectivity for devices like smartphones, 
              laptops,
       and IoT devices without cables. Key hardware includes wireless routers, access points, and adapters, with extenders or 
              repeaters used for broader coverage. They provide mobility, flexibility, and easy installation but face challenges like 
              potential interference, limited range, and security risks if signals are not properly encrypted.
