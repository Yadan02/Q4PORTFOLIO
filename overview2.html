<p>Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, such as data, hardware, and services. 
       Key networking components include devices like routers, switches, hubs, and network interfaces, which facilitate the communication
       between systems. Network addressing, typically achieved using IP addresses, ensures each device has a unique identifier, 
       enabling proper data routing across the network. The benefits of networking are vast, including enhanced communication, 
       resource sharing, cost savings, and improved collaboration. Networks can be classified into various types, such as Local 
       Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), each serving different geographical 
       scales and purposes based on the needs of the users and the organization.</p>

<p>A wired network is a type of network where devices are connected through physical cables, typically Ethernet cables, to
       enable communication and data transfer. This network setup requires hardware such as routers, switches, network interface
       cards (NICs), and cables (usually Cat5e, Cat6, or fiber-optic). A wired network is known for its reliability, providing stable 
       connections with minimal interference compared to wireless options. It offers higher speeds and better security since data
       transmission is confined to physical connections. However, it can be less flexible, as devices are tethered to the network
       via cables, limiting mobility. Additionally, the installation process can be more time-consuming and costly, especially for
       large or complex setups. On the plus side, wired networks generally provide faster speeds, lower latency, and a more secure 
       environment compared to wireless networks. On the downside, the physical cables can clutter spaces and limit the ease of adding 
       or relocating devices.</p>

       <p>Wireless networks are communication systems that transmit data without the need for physical cables or wires, 
              using radio frequencies or infrared signals. These networks enable devices such as smartphones, laptops, and 
              IoT devices to connect to the internet or other systems over short or long distances. The primary hardware required
              for a wireless network includes a wireless router, which broadcasts the network signal; wireless access points (APs),
              which extend coverage; and wireless adapters in devices to receive and send data. Some networks may also require additional 
              equipment like network extenders or repeaters for larger coverage areas. The pros of wireless networks include mobility, 
              flexibility, and ease of installation, as they eliminate the need for extensive wiring. However, they also come with cons, 
              such as potential interference from other devices, limited range compared to wired networks, and security concerns, as
              wireless signals can be intercepted if not properly encrypted.</p>
