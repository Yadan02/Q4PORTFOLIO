<p>Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, such as data, hardware, and services. 
       Key networking components include devices like routers, switches, hubs, and network interfaces, which facilitate the communication
       between systems. Network addressing, typically achieved using IP addresses, ensures each device has a unique identifier, 
       enabling proper data routing across the network. The benefits of networking are vast, including enhanced communication, 
       resource sharing, cost savings, and improved collaboration. Networks can be classified into various types, such as Local 
       Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), each serving different geographical 
       scales and purposes based on the needs of the users and the organization.</p>

<p>A wired network refers to a communication system that connects devices using physical cables, such as Ethernet or fiber-optic cables,
       to transmit data between them. This type of network is typically known for its stability, speed, and reliability compared to wireless
       networks. In a wired setup, each device, such as computers, printers, and servers, is physically connected to a central hub or switch,
       which directs the data traffic. Wired networks are commonly used in business environments, data centers, and homes where consistent,
       high-speed internet access is required. While setting up a wired network can be more complex due to the need for physical wiring, it
       generally provides lower latency and greater security than wireless alternatives.</p>
