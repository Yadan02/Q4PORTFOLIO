<p>Networking refers to connecting computers, devices, and systems to share resources, exchange data, and facilitate 
       communication. It encompasses both the physical hardware, such as routers, switches, and cables, and the software protocols 
       governing data transmission, such as TCP/IP. Networking can occur on different scales, from local area networks (LANs) that 
       connect devices within a small area, like an office, to wide area networks (WANs) that span large geographical regions. The growth 
       of the internet and cloud technologies has expanded the scope of networking, enabling seamless global communication and data sharing.
       Effective networking ensures that data flows securely and efficiently, supporting everything from business operations to personal 
       connections.</p>

<p>A wired network refers to a communication system that connects devices using physical cables, such as Ethernet or fiber-optic cables,
       to transmit data between them. This type of network is typically known for its stability, speed, and reliability compared to wireless
       networks. In a wired setup, each device, such as computers, printers, and servers, is physically connected to a central hub or switch,
       which directs the data traffic. Wired networks are commonly used in business environments, data centers, and homes where consistent,
       high-speed internet access is required. While setting up a wired network can be more complex due to the need for physical wiring, it
       generally provides lower latency and greater security than wireless alternatives.</p>
